# ðŸ“° Fake and Real News Prediction

This project is a **Machine Learning application** that predicts whether a given news article is **Fake** or **Real**.  
It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for text preprocessing and a trained ML model (stored as `.pkl` files) for classification.  
A simple **Flask web interface** is included to interact with the model.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Pre-trained ML model (`fake_real_model.pkl`) for prediction.
- TF-IDF vectorizer (`tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`) for consistent text preprocessing.
- Web interface built with **Flask** and **HTML templates**.
- Easy to extend with new models or datasets.
